    The value and address of x are not different before and after the fooB
    call. In fooB, a pointer to x is passed into the function. No alterations
    are done when dereferencing the pointer. While there is a modification
    to the value jptr is pointing to within fooB, it does not change the
    physical location of where x resides - a pointer is just reassigned 
    within the scope of fooB. The variable x within main has no knowledge
    of what happens to a pointer within the scope of fooB()
